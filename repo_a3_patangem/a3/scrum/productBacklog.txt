TYPE     : BUG 3.0 : Patangem : Completed
NAME     : Configure and use system
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE : 1 hour   ACTUAL :  10 minutes
ISSUE    : 
- demonstrates that they can run Paint on their dev platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYPE     : USER STORY 3.1 : Patangem : Completed
NAME     : Polyline
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE : 2 Hours   ACTUAL :  3 Hours
AS A     : user
ISSUE    : A button which allows me to draw a polyline. Once selected,
a left click on the canvas places the first polyline point.
Each subsequent left click on the canvas
adds a line segment to the polyline. A final right click ends the polyline.
The next left click starts another polyline.  As the mouse moves over
the canvas, the current potential next line segment is on display.

IMPL DTL : Implementation details for polyline
See squiggle for example. There is no mouse drag for polyline.

TYPE     : USER STORY 3.2 : Patangem :  Completed
NAME     : Save
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE : 3 hours   ACTUAL : 2.5 Hours
AS A     : user
ISSUE    : a user interface that allows me to specify where to save the
Paint, then saves all Paint commands to a file.
IMPL DTL : Implementation details for the save feature:

This amounts to saving the command list to a file according
to the Paint Save File Format.
Do this using what you have learned in class about FileIO.
You can find the format of the save file in the
project under paintSaveFileFormat.txt.

TYPE     : USER STORY 3.3 : Patangem : Completed
NAME     : Load
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE : 2 hours   ACTUAL :3
AS A     : user
ISSUE    : the ability to open previously saved Paint programs. A file dialog
should appear, allowing me to choose the file to load. If the file is not in
the correct format, provide an appropriate error message.
IMPL DTL : Implementation details for the load feature:

Read a file in Paint Save File Format, being careful to parse
each line using an appropriate regular expression/expressions.
You can find the format of the save file in the
project under paintSaveFileFormat.txt.

The result of the execution of the load method should modify
the given PaintModel. Some ShapeCommands will require careful parsing.
For example, you will have to walk
through a squiggle to properly parse it using Patterns and groups.

TYPE     : BUG 3.4: UTORID : STATUS : NotStarted (NotStarted,InProgress, Incomplete,Complete)
NAME     : Visitor1: Improve architecture for drawing
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 3
ESTIMATE : (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days)    ACTUAL :
AS A     :
ISSUE    :
DEPENDSON:
IMPL DTL :

Impose the Visitor Design Pattern on the Model (PaintModel and PaintCommands).
This results in all drawing functionality being moved out of the Model.
That is, after this BUG is complete, an appropriate DrawingVisitor will
visit the PaintModel and render the screen using
a graphics context. Some Model methods may be removed after this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 3.5: UTORID : STATUS : NotStarted (NotStarted,InProgress, Incomplete,Complete)
NAME     : Visitor2: Improve architecture for save
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 4
ESTIMATE : (1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days)    ACTUAL :  
AS A     : 
ISSUE    :
DEPENDSON: USER STORY 3.2 and USER STORY 3.4
IMPL DTL : 

Now that USER STORY 3.2 and 3.4 are in place...

Apply the Visitor Design Pattern to the save function. After this, the model 
will not implement the save function, so you should remove PaintModel.save.

TYPE     : USER STORY 3.6 : Patangem STATUS : Completed
NAME     : AI Integration for Paint File Format
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE : 4 hours   ACTUAL :
AS A     : developer
ISSUE    : Enhance the Paint application by integrating AI to generate and modify Paint File Format files.
IMPL DTL : Implementation details for AI Integration:

Understand the provided classes (Ollama, OllamaNumberedFile, OllamaPaint) and their roles in generating and modifying Paint File Format files. Use the assigned Ollama server to ensure functionality, replacing placeholder servers with the assigned server, and validate by running `OllamaNumberedFile.main()` to confirm file generation in the home directory.

Complete the following methods in `OllamaPaint`:
- `newFile`, `newFile1`, `newFile2`, `newFile3`: These methods should generate files in the Paint File Format with creative, varied, and parsable content.
- `modifyFile`, `modifyFile1`, `modifyFile2`, `modifyFile3`: These methods should modify existing Paint File Format files with interesting and logical changes.

Ensure all generated and modified files are parsable, adhering to the Paint Save File Format. Validate outputs against the provided sample files (`samples1.zip` and `samples2.zip`) to demonstrate improvements in creativity and accuracy. Test the integration thoroughly to confirm reliable file generation and modification.
